Instrumental Notes  =
=====================

Project Status
---------------
  ==Overall Strategy
    - Find out who my instructor is for this project
    - Write up an overview of what we expect to be a
    passable website. Include a section of concerns,
    questions, contradictions in the rubric, etc.
    Once we know who the instructor is, send that shit.
    - Once message is sent, begin work, using current
    strategy.
    - Harrass instructor, send a message every other
    day. 
  ==Not Done Yet
    - Record video of work
    - Validations
    - Renter Spotlight (must use scope method)
    - Facebook login
    - Make instruments disappear from index when rented
  ==Debugs
    - Make sure that instruments that are currently being 
    rented cannot be removed from a rental by another user
    selecting the same instrument from the instrument list
    - Redirect non-logged in users to login if they attempt
    to do anything else. Otherwise, we get errors in browser.
  ==Notes To Self
    - The app shines once you click the links on the /rentals
    page. This might fill some nested url requirements.
