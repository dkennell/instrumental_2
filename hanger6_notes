Rails Project

Name: Hangar6
Desc: Airline managment tool
Models: Aircraft, Passengers, Flights
User: airport admins

Realism note: obviously, this app does not perfectly reflect
a real airport; the relationship between airline and airport
staff is complex. I've mixed and matched responsibilities to 
create a domain that works. As such, the domain is largly fictional, but I think that by adjusting this reality a 
bit, it provides a fun and interesting scope for this project.
As such, in this domain, not only are all planes owned by the airline, they have the responsibility of coordinating flights
as well.

Relationships
---------------
aircraft has_many flights
aircraft has_many passengers through flights

Models
--------
Aircraft: registration_num(6 chr) model, age, fuel_level, passenger_capacity
Passenger: flight_id, name, age, class(1st, 2nd, coach), miles
Flight: aircraft_id, (departure_from), destination, dept_time, arr_time, passenger_count, distance
User: role, name

Controllers
-----------
Aircraft - index, show, new+create, destroy(sell)
Flight - index, show, new+create, edit+update destroy(cancel)
Passenger - index, show, new+create, edit+update, destroy
User - index, show, new+create, edit+update, destroy

Permissions for Users
----------------------
reservation_agent:
  view flights index & show
  view aircraft show
  view passengers index & show
  create a passenger
  give a passenger a  flight
flight_dispatcher
  view aircraft index
  reservation_agent +
  create a flight
  give an aircraft a flight

airline_administrator
  flight_dispatcher +
  create/destroy aircraft
  destroy(cancel) flights
  destroy(delete) passengers
  view other users
  create(hire) other users
  destroy(fire) other non-admin users

Checkboxes
------------
Nested form writer: can create a plane while creating a flight
Omniauth: can login from linkedin


TO DO
------

Should be able to edit a flight's details from index, or
    delete it.
Create button for deleting/firing employees
Add 'km' to Distance form field for new flight
Create a validation that makes sure arr_time is after 
dept_time
Fix login, not working.

Notes
------
No reason for new_user form; that's wut sign_up's for




Extra credit
------------
Use paperclip to give each aircracft a picture attribute

Accepted Shortcomings of App
-----------------------------
 - Passenger counts on flights are simulated; they do not reflect
      the actualy number of associated passengers
 - Cities are fake, and the distances between them are random 
 - A passenger's frequent flyer miles do not actually change.
      Ideally, they would change to reflect the distances of the
      the flights they take
 - It may be a BIT unrealistic that an airline starts an entirely 
      new flight for a single passenger
