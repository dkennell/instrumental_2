Instrumental Technical Overview
-------------------------------
3 models - User, Rental, and Instrument

Nav bar has 8 links:
Home || Log In || Sign Up || Log Out || Rent || Your Rentals || Instruments || Renter Spotlight

Rent
-----
url : /rentals/new
 - Includes a form for a new rental and a nested form to create
 an instrument as well

Your Rentals
-------------
url: /rentals
 - Shows an index of rentals w/ instruments
 - Clicking a rental reveals:
   url:/rentals/:id/instruments
     - This shows some more detail of the rental as well as
       the list of instruments that we saw before, as well
       as a link to add a new instrument:
       - url:/rentals/:id/instruments/new
         - A form for an instrument that gets added to the
           rental

Concerns
--------
Every time the user creates a new rental, s/he also creates
a new instrument. This may be unrealistic, but I needed to 
fill the 'nested form' requirement. Attempts to include both
a select field AND the option to create a new instrument 
instead quickly became too complex. Is this setup okay?

Is it okay that I don't have user nested resources in the
project? Does having my rental nested resource fill the 
nested resource requirement?

The nested rentals/:id/instruments index functions more like
a rental show page, but that's really just for user satisfaction;
I can't think of a time when a user would want just a list
of instruments without other stuff about the rental. Is this
okay?
